# boredom

Monorepo to keep me entertained coding while learning more advanced concepts, all while trying to apply the best approaches to software engineering (architecture, testing, coding, efficiency, reusability...)

## Architecture

A monorepo with apps and packages:

### Apps:

Standalone apps that could run independently of anything.

### Packages:

Non executable code (on it's own) that could be reused among multiple packages or services.
